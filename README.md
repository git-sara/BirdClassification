# BirdClassification
In this repo, I classified birds based on their conservation status merely upon their size.
with the data found :https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/blob/main/data/birds.csv
Since there was imbalance in status: I used SMOTE
and since I wanted test set to have all classes, I used stratification.
it seems like randomForest outperforms the other classifiers significantly.
